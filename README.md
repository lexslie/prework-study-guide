# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My motivation to build this project creating the study guide was to learn a different approach to storing and studying my academic notes. Having an organized study guide to refer to solves the problem of being overwhelmed by so many academic notes due to lack of organization. I learned how to organize and create my own digital study guide through the use of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section about each topic, like HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. By opening the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) you can see JavaScript running as well as suggestions on what to study the topics learned through the prework. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. Once a console panel opens below or to the side of the webpage, there will be a list of topics that were learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
